I created both Bash scripts in VSCode as a project for the "Relational Database Certification" from freeCodeCamp.org. The insert_data.sh enters the information from the games.csv file into the my worldcup database created in PostgreSQL. The queries.sh runs the required queries. Outputs from the queries.sh file can be compared to the expected_output.txt file provided.
